Semantic Elements Summary

HTML5 requires "div" tags to separate sections of the webpages. These div's filled up HTML code and made it difficult to read. 
In an effort to improve, semantics were invented. Semantics are preformatted div tags that provide the same functionality but
are easier to read, provide better searchability, allow devs to understand your code and it's function better. For example, 
a developer might be inclined to write <div id="header">, but now the dev can just type <header> much like the <body> and <p>
tags that most are accustom to. These semantic tags that were selected were chosen by Google after they analyzed over a Billion 
webpages and found the most used id's assigned to div's.
